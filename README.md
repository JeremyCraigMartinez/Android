1. Introduction
1.1 Background


The Intelligent Remote DiAbetes Health Coach is a smart phone app for android. It allows a person to monitor their activity level and record food intake. This app is designed primarily for researchers to collect physical activity data and food intake from individuals who are part of a research study group. It utilizes the latest Restful Services technology to captured and transmit sensor data over a secured HTTPS connection. IReach app uses the sensors in the phone to gather activity data based on the type of activity that is performed and the duration of said activity. The data captured is sent to the server for analysis as to what type of activity (e.g. Running, Walking, Jogingâ€¦). Physicians and researchers can then use this data to provide quality care to their patients/subjects.


What's New:

The Android App Store contains many variations of similar apps that count the number of steps that a person walks/ jogs and estimate the caloric expenditure. What sets IReach apart from all others is its ability to classify  the activity type a person is performing by comparing the sensor output to the machine learning algorithm that we have implemented. 


Environment:

Ireach is designed to run on the smart phone and capture and transmit sensor data. Ireach currently supports android's lollipop operating system with but it also has backwards compatibility to support devices as old as android 4.4 KitKat. The User Interface (UI) is written purely in C# using Xamarin.Android Framework which uses Microsoft's latest .Net technology enhancing the overall user experience and performance. 


1.2 Design Goals


Android App:

The design of the app consists of the following. A graphical user interface (GUI) used to visualize data entered by user or generated by the activity detector. The GUI is also important in providing feedback to the user based on the data. Due to the sensitive nature of the data that is collected and to protected users confidentiality we have implemented a secure authentication using Email and password. All users of iReach will be required to login prior to accessing app data. Personal Data that is saved on the web database is only accessible to the users physician and or the authorized research coordinators of the particular group that the user belongs to.

Local data storage 
		
Storing data locally is an essential part of every app, it reduces the amount of network data required to access data remotely and the cost associated with using wireless data plans. Ireach uses SQLite local database to store user profile information and Phone Sensor Data. The database uses Object Relational Mapping or ORM to create tables with associated values. Once a Wifi connection is established the app handles the transmission of data to the server. As of version 1.0 the app is only able to transmit the data to server for analysis. Once the data is analyzed, physicians and researchers.
